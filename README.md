# TypeCheat
TypeRacer using selenium and PySide GUI.
## Usage
After running the cheat navigate to the settings tab and click relaunch. This will launch the browser that Selenium will use. Once the pages loads you can use TypeRacer as if you are playing normally. If you want to cheat set the WPM you want in the cheat tab and click the "Get text" button when you are in a race. Once you have the Selected text click the "Start typing" button when the race starts and TypeCheat will start typing.
